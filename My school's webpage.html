	Coding tells a machine which actions to perform and how to complete tasks. Programming languages provide the rules for building websites, apps, and other computer-based technologies.

		How does coding work?
	</h2>
	<p>
		Computer programming languages, developed through a series of numerical or alphabetic codes, instruct machines to complete specific actions. Computer coding functions much like a manual.<br> </br>

A programmer or developer writes instructions describing the information and tasks needed to create a visual or to perform a task. Computers scan extensive coded manuals very quickly, executing the tasks that create and run a successful website or application. Displaying an image or section of text, changing font styles, and opening emails all require instructions included in the coded manual.<br> </br>

Users interact with websites and apps with the help of these coded instructions. The code itself does not show up on the screen. Instead, people see the words and images a developer or programmer asks the computer to display.<br> </br>

		Types of coding languages
	</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>5 major types of programming languages:</strong><br> </br>

	1.<b> Procedural programming languages</b> <br> </br>
A procedural language follows a sequence of statements or commands in order to <mark><em>achieve a desired output</em></mark>. Each series of steps is called a procedure, and a program written in one of these languages will have one or more procedures within it. Common examples of procedural languages include:<br> </br>

1.<small>C and C++</small><br> </br>

2.<small>Java</small><br> </br>

3.<small>Pascal</small><br> </br>

4.<small>BASIC</small><br> </br>


    2. <b> Functional programming languages</b> <br> </br>
Rather than focusing on the execution of statements, functional languages focus on the output of mathematical functions and evaluations. Each function–a reusable module of code–performs a specific task and returns a result. The result will vary depending on what data you input into the function. Some popular functional programming languages include:

1.<small>Scala</small> <br> </br>

2.<small>Erlang</small> <br> </br>

3.<small>Haskell</small> <br> </br>

4.<small>Elixir</small> <br> </br>

5.<small>F#</small> <br> </br>


     3. <b>Object-oriented programming languages (OOP)</b> <br> </br>
This type of language treats a program as a group of objects composed of data and program elements, known as attributes and methods. Objects can be reused within a program or in other programs. This makes it a popular language type for complex programs, as code is easier to reuse and scale. Some common object-oriented languages include:<br> </br>

1.<small>Java</small> <br> </br>

2.<small>Python</small><br> </br>

3.<small>PHP</small><br> </br>

4.<small>C++</small><br> </br>

5.<small>Ruby</small><br> </br>
